# Rainbow Challenge
> Rainbow Challegen is an all-in-one tracking and goal-setting tool to help you to improve your diet by eating more vegetables and fruits.

## Motivation
> As a former dietitian, I was inspired to build an app that makes eating vegetables and fruits fun! Tracking vegetable/fruit eaten and the app tracks total colors, total number of vegetable/fruit in each color and total number of vegetable/fruit. Once goal is hit, the app will display a congrat message.
